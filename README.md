### ⚙️ **Configuration**

The setup script automatically handles configuration. You only need:

```bash
# Required: Google Gemini API Key (setup script will ask for this)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional: Azure Speech Recognition (add later if you want voice features)
AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=your_azure_speech_key
AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=your_region
```

**Note**: Speech recognition is completely optional. If Azure credentials are not provided, the microphone button will be automatically hidden from all interfaces.

## 🚀 Quick Start & Installation

### ⚡ Three Simple Steps (All Operating Systems)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TechyCSR/OpenCluely.git
   cd OpenCluely
   ```

2. **Get your Gemini API key** (Required)
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
   - Click "Create API Key" 
   - Copy the key (you'll need it in step 3)

3. **Run the setup script** (One command does everything!)
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
  

**That's it!** The setup script will:
- Install all dependencies automatically
- Create and configure your `.env` file
- Build the app (if needed)
- Launch OpenCluely ready to use (if not works use npm install & then npm start)

### 💻 Platform-Specific Notes

- **Windows**: Use Git Bash (comes with Git for Windows), WSL, or any bash environment
- **macOS/Linux**: Use your regular terminal
- **All platforms**: No manual npm commands needed - the setup script handles everything

### 🎛️ Setup Script Options

```bash
./setup.sh --build          # Build distributable for your OS
./setup.sh --ci             # Use npm ci instead of npm install
./setup.sh --no-run         # Setup only, don't launch the app
./setup.sh --install-system-deps  # Install sox for microphone (optional)
```

### 🔧 **Optional: Azure Speech Setup** (For Voice Features)

Voice recognition is completely optional. The setup script will create a `.env` file with just the required Gemini key. To add voice features:

1. Get Azure Speech credentials:
   - Visit [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
   - Create a Speech Service
   - Copy your key and region

2. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   # Already configured by setup script
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

   # Add these for voice features (optional)
   AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=your_azure_speech_key
   AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=your_region
   ```

3. Restart the app - microphone buttons will now appear automatically

<summary>🧩 <b> Troubleshooting</summary>

### Setup Issues

- **setup.sh not found or won't run**
  - Make sure you're in the OpenCluely directory: `cd OpenCluely`
  - Make the script executable: `chmod +x setup.sh`
  - On Windows, use Git Bash (comes with Git for Windows)

- **Setup script stops with exit code 130**
  - This means you pressed Ctrl+C. Just run `./setup.sh` again

- **Node or npm not found**
  - Install Node.js 18+ from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
  - Restart your terminal and try again

### App Issues

- **Electron won't start or shows blank window (Linux)**
  - Try: `npm run dev`
  - Ensure X11/XWayland is available if running in headless environments

- **macOS screen capture doesn't work**
  - Grant "Screen Recording" permission in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording
  - Quit and relaunch the app after granting permission

- **Windows SmartScreen blocks the app**
  - Click "More info" → "Run anyway" or use `npm start` during development

- **Microphone/voice not working**
  - Voice is optional - ignore related warnings if you don't need it
  - To enable: install `sox` (Linux/macOS) and add Azure keys to `.env`
